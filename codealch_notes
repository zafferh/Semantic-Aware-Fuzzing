STEPS:
Clone the repo
Install all dependencies listed on the README page
set up the config and any directories
Run it


AFTER CLONING:
make sure ALL dependencies are in place

CONF:
for conf, no paths starting with ~, must be a full path like /home/lee/Desktop/5271/preproc

MUST define paths to preproc_dir, tmp_dir, bug_dir in config

seed_path definition is not recursive, CodeAlch only looks at seeds in that dir

CodeAlchemist only looks at .js files in the seed_path

RUNNING:
when running, run like so with config specified as a full path:
dotnet bin/Main.dll rewrite /home/lee/Desktop/5271/CodeAlchemist/conf/MOZ.conf

For every run of CodeAlchemist (starting with seed preprocessing), the preproc, bug, and tmp directories should EXIST and be EMPTY.

If you see an error like "Need more diverse seeds" you probably have a bad seed path.
